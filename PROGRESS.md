Initialized the git repo with a root `.gitignore` covering `data/raw/`, `.env`, `node_modules/`, `.next/` and Python caches, and pushed `main` to [michaelkot1/global-policy-impacts](https://github.com/michaelkot1/global-policy-impacts). Scaffolded `pipeline/` as a uv project with stub modules for each data source, the policy loader, the event study and `build_db.py`, and scaffolded `web/` as a Next.js app (TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind) with `better-sqlite3`, `recharts`, `d3-geo` and `us-atlas` installed.

**Issues**

- The GitHub CLI wasn't logged in, so pushing required a one-time browser device login (`gh auth login --web`).
- npm warns that Node v23.11 is outside the engine range of `eslint-visitor-keys` (wants `^22.13` or `>=24`). Installs work, but switching to Node 22 LTS or 24 would silence it.
- uv picked up the Anaconda Python (3.13.9) rather than a uv-managed one; the project requires Python `>=3.12`, so this works but is worth knowing if environments differ.
